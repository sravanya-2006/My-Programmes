        <p>VIT-AP, all programmes have been carefully crafted for a holistic development of the students. The curriculum is designed to build strong fundamental concepts in tandem with applications based on industry requirements. The emphasis is on autonomous learning with a balanced mix of co- and extra-curricular activities enabling students to chart their own course. This is achieved through a Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCSTM) in which students can select courses, faculty, timings, venue and design a personalized time-table in each semester, to suit their interests and aspirations.</p>
