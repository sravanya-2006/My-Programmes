#Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and functionalities within the language. These words are part of the Python syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) because they serve specific purposes in the language. Python keywords are case-sensitive, which means they must be written in lowercase letters.

#As of my last update in September 2021, Python has the following keywords:


"""and         as          assert      async       await
break       class       continue    def         del
elif        else        except      False       finally
for         from        global      if          import
in          is          lambda      None        nonlocal
not         or          pass        raise       return
True        try         while       with        yield"""


'''and, or, not: Used for logical operations.
if, else, elif: Used for conditional branching.
while, for: Used for loop constructs.
def: Used for defining functions.
return: Used to return a value from a function.
break, continue: Used for flow control in loops.
True, False, None: Used for Boolean values and to represent the absence of a value.
class: Used for defining classes and object-oriented programming.
import, from, as: Used for importing modules and managing namespaces.
try, except, finally: Used for exception handling.
with: Used for context management with the "context manager" protocol.
lambda: Used to create anonymous (inline) functions.
It is essential to remember that you should not use these keywords as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers in your Python code. Doing so will result in syntax errors or unexpected behavior, as Python will treat these words as language constructs rather than user-defined entities'''
